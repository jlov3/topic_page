          <span>Fletcher utilizes her out-of-the-box ideas as an author and combines these with her well developed people skills from Cabot Cove's tight knit community to make connections nobody else ever could or does. She has a strong sense of morality and never stops an investigation, even though she is not an official law enforcer and it is often dangerous to get involved. Jessica Fletcher is also a kind woman, who truly understands people and sees the best in them. Often throughout the episodes, the murderer is acting only on emotion or the murder was accidental, and Fletcher acknowledges their remorse with understanding. But this does not stop her from putting them behind bars. </span>

          <span>Jessica Fletcher is an older woman from the fictional bayside town Cabot Cove. It's a small community, where everybody knows everybody. Becoming bored with the usual activities with her friends her age, and becoming inspired by a poorly written murder-mystery play she attended in their company, Fletcher decides to give writing a shot. Incidentally, she becomes a (worldwide?) bestseller, and is now regularly entangled in murders. </span>

          <span>Angela Lansbury, born 1925 played Jessica Fletcher, perhaps her most prominent role. Lansbury passed in 2022. For excellence in her role as Jessica Fletcher, Lansbury was nominated for several Golden Globes and Emmy Awards, and indeed awarded four Golden Globes. </span>
